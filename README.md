## Description

I have been tasked with creating a finance and client tracking application to help keep track of all the clients and various information, such as start dates, phone numbers, payment amount, banks, etc.

Then, as I was building out the app, I foresaw further potential to implement additional features that could really make the app robust. Features such as sorting, backups, date of backup, and restoration should the need arise.

It was a new challenge dealing with so many input fields (14 of them), and select field, hello TypeScript, and coming up with a clean solution to display all of that data reasonably and concisely.

Building this project has given me a deeper insight into TypeScript, and while I haven't used all of TypeScript's features, the potential was easier to see and understand.

Third iteration, after I made some updates to fix major bugs and refresh the design making the app ready for use.

First iteration of the app. This was in the early build stages, prior to any extra features of the app.

This is the second iteration, after fixing bugs and adding much more functionalities to the app.
