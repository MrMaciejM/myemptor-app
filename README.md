# myEmptor App

## Description

I have been tasked with creating a financial/client tool application to keep a track of all the clients and various information.

This README.md will be updated further once the app is complete.

## Screenshots

First iteration of the app. Still currently in progress, and is not the final build. There's more functions planned for this app.
